Made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.github.com/PatrickGlaubers">PatrickGlaubers</a>

In this project, a CRUD using C Language was created with the aim of storing some data about fictional students and fictional subjects. Although C might not be the best option to create this project, some knowledge acquired during the development of this project could be mentioned, such as:

- pointers;
- BST structure;
- BST operations and Time Complexity of these operations;
- Collaboration between team members (despite the fact that we didn't use a VCS).
